# VBA_Challenge
Module 2 Challenge

## Project Overview
In this challenge, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. I create a script in VBA that did the following:
* It loops through all the stocks for one year and output a ticker symbol.
* It then listed the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* It output the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. 

## Analysis
For 2018, the script found the following:
